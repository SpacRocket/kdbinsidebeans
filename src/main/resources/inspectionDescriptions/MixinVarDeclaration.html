<p>Q works incorrect with mixin variable declaration inside a lambda.</p>

<h1>Case #1: Global after local</h1>
<p>If you try to assign a global variable with the same name after local declaration, like:</p>
<pre>{ myVar:10; myVar::20 }</pre>
<p>In this case global double colons are treated as local assignment that could case an error.</p>

<h1>Case #2: Local after global</h1>
<p>In opposite way, when first declare a variable as global one and try to assign local value, like:</p>
<pre>{myVar::10; myVar:20} </pre>
<p>an error will be thrown.</p>
