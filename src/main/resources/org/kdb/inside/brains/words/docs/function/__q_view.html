<p>Where <code>x</code> is a list of partition values that serves as a filter for all queries against any partitioned
    table in the database, <code>x</code> is added as a constraint in the first sub-phrase of the where-clause of every
    query.</p>
<p><code>.Q.view</code> is handy when you are executing queries against partitioned or segmented tables. Recall that
    multiple tables can share the partitioning. <code>Q.view</code> can guard against runaway queries that ask for all
    historical data.</p>
