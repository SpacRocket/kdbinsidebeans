<p>Where </p>
<ul>
    <li><code>f</code> is a unary function</li>
    <li><code>h</code> is the handle to a websocket connection to a kdb+ session</li>
</ul>
<p><code>f[h]</code> is evaluated <em>after</em> a websocket connection has been closed.
    (Since V3.3t 2014.11.26.)</p>
<p>As the connection has been closed by the time <code>.z.wc</code> is called, there are strictly no remote values that
    can be put into <code>.z.a</code>, <code>.z.u</code> or <code>.z.w</code> so the local values are returned.</p>
<p>This allows you to clean up things like tables of users keyed by handle.</p>
