        <td>returns memory to the OS when either <code>.Q.gc[]</code> is called or an allocation fails, hence has a
            performance advantage, but can be more difficult to dimension or manage memory requirements.

        <td>returns (certain types of) memory to the OS as soon as no longer referenced; has an associated performance
            overhead.
